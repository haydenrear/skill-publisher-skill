"""`skt check` — new-version and sync-with-root notifications.

Pull-side (every tier): compare each change-managed unit's installed
gitHash against its remote tip (`git ls-remote`). Push-side (ROOT tier
only): a unit's store checkout that is dirty or ahead of its remote is
work nobody else can see — prompt the publish. Project homes are
updated from `wt`-created imports, so they get pull-side messages only.

`--cached` is contract-cache-only: it reads the state file and NOTHING
else — no subprocess, no network, no fallback to a live check, whatever
state the cache is in. That is the path SKT-6 wires into tool-event
hooks, so a cold home must stay exactly as cheap as a warm one. The
report carries a typed `cache_state`:

  fresh    -> the cached result verbatim, plus `from_cache` metadata
  missing  -> no cache record exists; nothing was checked
  expired  -> a record exists but is past --ttl; its content is
              preserved under `stale` (text output labels each line
              [stale]) and is never presented as current

Exit codes: 0 = nothing to report; 10 = notifications exist. Both are
success — 10 exists so hooks can decide to inject without parsing.
`cache_state` missing/expired is the documented non-error outcome: exit
0 with empty top-level `notifications` (an absent result is "nothing to
report", and stale notifications must not re-fire as exit 10 on every
tool call). Refreshing is the live path's job — `skt check`, or the
SessionStart hook's bounded refresh — never the hook tool-event path's.

The live path owns one wall-clock deadline (NETWORK_BUDGET_SECONDS),
shared by the remote and root-local phases: every git child runs in its
own process group and the whole group is SIGKILLed and reaped when its
clamped timeout fires, queued executor work is cancelled at the
deadline instead of awaited, and units left unresolved are reported
`unverifiable`. A refresh that resolved nothing writes no cache record,
and the record it does write lands by atomic rename — `--cached` must
never serve a failure, or a partial write, as a fresh success.
